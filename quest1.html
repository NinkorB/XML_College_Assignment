    <h1 align="center">Welcome to the Static Webpage Example</h1>
    <p>
        This webpage demonstrates a static HTML page with a simple table and additional textual content. A static webpage is a fixed web page that is delivered to the user's web browser exactly as stored. It primarily focuses on displaying content and does not change based on user interaction.
    </p>

    <h2 align="left">Static Table Example</h2>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="50%">
        <tr bgcolor="#f0f0f0">
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Course</th>
            <th>State</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Ninkor Chandra Barman</td>
            <td>MCA</td>
            <td>Assam</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Rahul Shukla</td>
            <td>MCA</td>
            <td>UP</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Ujjal Roy</td>
            <td>MCA</td>
            <td>WB</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Features of a Static Webpage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Static webpages are fixed and display pre-defined content.</li>
        <li>They are simple to create and require minimal resources.</li>
        <li>Static webpages are faster to load as there is no server-side processing.</li>
        <li>They are ideal for displaying information like company details, contact pages, or portfolios.</li>
        <li>They cannot handle dynamic functionality like user logins or database queries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advantages of Static Webpages</h2>
    <p>
        Static webpages are great for small-scale websites or projects that do not require frequent updates. They are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cost-effective: Since static pages don’t require complex backend support, they are less expensive to host and maintain.</li>
        <li>Secure: Static pages don’t involve server-side processing, making them less vulnerable to security threats.</li>
        <li>Efficient: They load quickly because the content is directly served from the server without additional processing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Limitations of Static Webpages</h2>
    <p>
        Despite their simplicity, static webpages have certain limitations:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Not Interactive: They lack dynamic elements and cannot respond to user input.</li>
        <li>Manual Updates: Every change requires editing the HTML file, which can be time-consuming for large websites.</li>
        <li>Limited Scalability: They are not suitable for applications with extensive functionality or large data handling requirements.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In summary, static webpages are an excellent choice for basic websites that prioritize speed and simplicity. However, for more advanced applications, dynamic webpages are recommended.
